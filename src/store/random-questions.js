// Cleanse after fetching:
//     Look for references to "actor", "actress", "who played", etc to get rid of references to non-movie content. This should be filtered out because the answers must be in the popularStarWarsInfo array. Some cases have the character name along with the actor/actress.
// Look for references to specific movies, Sith, Jedi, Yoda and bounty hunters in the questions. These likely need specific answerOptions added.
// Search for Jimmy Smits and remove his name and the end of the question asking about him.

        answerExplanation:
          "When the Millennium Falcon came out of hyperspace to find no Alderaan, they followed a lone TIE Fighter to what they realized, too late, was no moon. They were pulled onboard the Death Star, and commandeered some disguises in order to move about freely while looking for a solution to their problems. After Obi-Wan left to deactivate the tractor beam, Luke learned that Princess Leia had been captured and was scheduled to be executed. He then enlisted the help of Han and Chewie to stage a rescue. The trio made their way to the detention block and quickly took control of it. Luke found and freed the princess, but didn't have any escape plan, which resulted in the cell-block shootout, before the group bailed into the garbage chute. They were almost crushed by the masher, but R2-D2 was able to shut it down just in time. The gang then made their way through the Death Star back to the Falcon, where they were eventually able to leave, but only with the sacrifice of Obi-Wan Kenobi at the hands of Darth Vader. Once clear of the Death Star, Han and Luke still had to fend off four pursuing TIE Fighters. However, it had been Vader's plan for the Falcon to escape with a tracking beacon that would lead the Imperials straight to the hidden Rebel Base on Yavin IV.",

When making their way to the generator, the team spotted an Imperial patrol, and Han moved in to quietly neutralize the Scout Troopers. He accidentally stepped on a branch that snapped, alerting the troopers to his presence. Luke and Leia rushed down to help, and spotted two more troops already on speeder bikes. Luke and Leia jumped on the last remaining bike, and a chase through the trees ensued. During the chase, Luke commandeered another bike, and he and Leia split up to take on different targets. Luke eventually had to bail off his bike when struggling with his adversary, but managed to finish off the biker with his lightsaber.

          'The first space battle to ever be seen was the Battle of Yavin in "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope". The Rebel base at the time was on the fourth moon of the gas giant Yavin. The Empire tracked the Millennium Falcon to the base, and moved their station towards the moon. They were making their way around Yavin to get a clear shot at Yavin IV when the Rebels attacked the Death Star with X-wings and Y-wings. Darth Vader personally flew in the Battle of Yavin to ensure the safety of the Death Star. The Rebels were down to their last chance to destroy the Death Star when Luke flew down the trench.

          "Anakin Skywalker must have been guided by The Force, because the sheer number of unlikely events that happened to help him save the day are statistically near impossible. Anakin Skywalker, who had no actual starfighter training, was told to hide, so he chose a starfighter which used its autopilot to take him to the space battle above Naboo. He was eventually hit and spun into the hanger of the droid control ship, where he managed to avoid a collision in the confined and crowded spaces, and came to a screeching halt without tearing his ship apart. Droids quickly surrounded his ship, but did not attempt to take him prisoner while the ship cooled. When the ship was good to go again, Anakin started firing at the droids around his ship, and just happened to fire a pair of proton torpedoes into a conveniently unprotected reactor core.",

        answerExplanation:
          'Palpatine was a Sith Lord, and his single goal in his life was to create a Sith-run galaxy. He joined politics, first seen in "Episode I", as the senator from Naboo. He was then elected as Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, and was in office when the Clone Wars broke out. The Senate chose to keep him in office until the war\'s end. At the same time, it was Dath Sidious, the same man, who was secretly manipulating galactic events, including the leaders of the Trade Federation, and later, the Separatist Alliance. Thus, the entire Clone Wars were engineered by a single man in order to gain Sith dominance over the galaxy. In "Episode III", the Clone Wars ended with the death of General Grievous, and surrender of the Separatist Leaders. The Jedi learned from Anakin that Palpatine was a Sith Lord, and moved to arrest him, but the Sith Lord was able to defeat the Jedi (with the help of Anakin Skywalker at the last minute). Palpatine then issued Order 66 to the Grand Army of the Republic, ordering the clones to kill all Jedi. He also fabricated a story about the Jedi\'s attempts to take over the Republic, branding the Jedi as evil. Thus, Palpatine had the power of the Grand Army of the Republic behind him. His enemies, the Jedi, were all but destroyed, and the Senate allowed him to reform the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire with the promise of peace and stability.',

The poisonous bugs were almost able to end Padme's life, but Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker jumped in, and saved the day. Obi-Wan noticed the assassin droid hovering outside the window, and jumped out the window to grab onto it. Anakin then commandeered a speeder to go after his master. When Zam saw Obi-Wan coming at her, she used a sniper rifle to take down the droid, letting Obi-Wan plummet through the Coruscant traffic. Anakin caught his master, while Zam jumped into her own speeder, and a chase ensued. Anakin eventually jumped onto Zam's speeder, and made her crash on a pedestrian walkway. When on the ground, Anakin and Obi-Wan followed Zam into a cantina, where she attempted to kill Obi-Wan. But the Jedi was too fast for her, and she was disarmed.

To help the gungans, the humans sent what pilots they had to try to destroy the orbiting Droid Control Ship. Anakin was ordered to hide, so he got into the cockpit of an N1 Starfighter. He accidentally initiated the launch sequence, and took off to join the battle in space. The Naboo pilots were unable to significantly damage the Droid Control Ship; it was too well armed and shielded. Anakin was shot, and tumbled into the Control Ship's hangar, where he was given a clear shot at the main reactor. He destroyed the Control Ship, deactivating all the droids in the palace and holding the Gungans.",

          "In which movie was the Millennium Falcon nearly eaten by a Space Slug?",
        answer: "The Empire Strikes Back",
        answerExplanation:
          'In "Episode V", the Millennium Falcon was chock-full of problems, most notably, the hyperdrive wasn\'t working. When the Empire found the hidden Rebel base on Hoth, the Rebels had to make a hasty evacuation. Han, Chewie, Leia, and C-3PO made their escape on the Falcon, but were unable to jump to hyperspace. They had to outrun and out-fly Imperial forces through an asteroid field. Han dodged and weaved, and the pursuing TIE Fighters were destroyed by hurtling rocks. Then Han hid the Falcon in a cave, in a larger asteroid, where they could hide and make further repairs. Han soon realized that they weren\'t hiding in a cave, and quickly powered up the Falcon to make yet another escape, this time from being eaten by a giant Space Slug. Once again, out in open space, Han was pursued by the Imperials and unable to jump to hyperspace. His only option was to pull a daring manoeuvre, and hide on the back of a Star Destroyer. When the Star Destroyer ejected its garbage before jumping to hyperspace, Han detached his ship and floated away with it (it did look like a piece of junk). After the Imperials were gone, Han made his way for Bespin, to visit his old friend Lando Calrissian, to get the Falcon in working order. Unfortunately for Han, Boba Fett knew this trick, courtesy of Obi-Wan Kenobi in "Episode II", in the asteroids circling Geonosis, and tracked Han, allowing the Imperials to set up an ambush.',

Luckily, the Death Star was still under construction, and the Rebels were able to pilot their ships through the unfinished super weapon. Of the Rebel ships that entered the Death Star, some were destroyed, some diverted pursuit, and two actually made it through the narrow, twisting tunnels to the core. Wedge Antilles destroyed a power regulator while Lando Calrissian shot the main reactor itself. The two pilots barely made it out before they were engulfed in flames.",
